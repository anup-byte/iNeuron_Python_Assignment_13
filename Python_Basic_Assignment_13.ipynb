    "1) Excel is a binary file that holds information about all the worksheets in a workbook while CSV stands for \n",
    "   Comma Separated Values. It is a plain text format with a series of values separated by commas.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2) An Excel not only stores data but can also do operations on the data while A CSV file is just a text file,\n",
    "   it stores data but does not contain formatting, formulas, macros, etc. It is also known as flat files  \n",
    "    \n",
    "3) Excel is a spreadsheet that saves files into its own proprietary format viz xls or xlsx while CSV is a format\n",
    "   for saving tabular information into a delimited text file with extension .csv    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4) Files saved in excel cannot be opened or edited by text editors while CSV files can be opened or edited by\n",
    "   text editors like notepad.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5) In data-warehouse, Excel is preferable for detailed standardized schema specification while In \n",
    "   data-warehouse, CSV follows a fairly flat, simple schema    \n",
    "    \n",
    "6) Any programming language library to parse Excel data is generally larger, slower and complicated while \n",
    "   Any programming language to parse CSV data is trivial, generating it is extremely easy    \n",
    "    \n",
    "7) With no clear distinction or separation between numeric values and text, Excel can mess up with your postal \n",
    "   codes and credit card numbers with its auto formatting features while CSV is safe and can clearly \n",
    "   differentiate between the numeric values and text. CSV does not manipulate data and stores it as-is. \n",

    "8) In Excel, you have to have a start tag and end tag for each column in each row while In CSV, you write column\n",

    "10) Reading large files user is much easier in Excel for the end user. Also, you can have additional functions\n",
    "    like selecting individual cells for import, convert dates and time automatically, reading formulas and their\n",
    "    results, filters, sorting, etc. while Reading large files in CSV will not be as easier as Excel for the\n",
    "    End User.\n",
    "    \n",
    "11) Apart from text, data can also be stored in form of charts and graphs while Each record is stored as one \n",
    "    line of a text file, and every newline signifies a new database row. CSV can not store charts or graphs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "12) Excel file can be opened with Microsoft Excel doc only while CSV can be opened with any text editor in\n",
    "    Windows like notepad, MS Excel, Microsoft Works 9, etc. \n",
